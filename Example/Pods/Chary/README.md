## Requirements

- Swift 5.0 or higher (or 5.3 when using Swift Package Manager)
- iOS 10.0 or higher

### Only Swift Package Manager

- macOS 10.0 or higher
- tvOS 10.10 or higher

## Installation

### Cocoapods

Chary is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Chary'
```

### Swift Package Manager from XCode

- Add it using XCode menu **File > Swift Package > Add Package Dependency**
- Add **<https://github.com/hainayanda/Chary.git>** as Swift Package URL
- Set rules at **version**, with **Up to Next Major** option and put **1.0.1** as its version
- Click next and wait

### Swift Package Manager from Package.swift

Add as your target dependency in **Package.swift**

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/hainayanda/Chary.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.1"))
]
```

Use it in your target as `Chary`

```swift
 .target(
    name: "MyModule",
    dependencies: ["Chary"]
)
```

## Basic Usage

Two utilities come with Chary, `Atomic` propertyWrapper and `DispatchQueue` extensions

## Atomic propertyWrapper

Atomic propertyWrapper is a propertyWrapper to wrap a property so it could be accessed and edited atomically:

```swift
class MyClass {
    @Atomic var atomicString: String = "atomicString"
    ...
    ...
}
```

then the atomicString will be Thread safe regardless of where it is accessed or edited.

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    myClass.atomicString = "from main thread"
}
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    myClass.atomicString = "from global thread"
}
```

## DispatchQueue Extensions

Chary has some DispatchQueue Extension that will help when dealing with multithreaded.

### Registering DispatchQueue detection

You can register `DispatchQueue` for detection so it will be available for check:

```swift
myQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "myQueue")
myQueue.registerDetection()
```

So later you can check the current DispatchQueue like this:

```swift
let isRunInMyQueue = DispatchQueue.current == myQueue
```

Calling `current` will automatically register all system DispatchQueue like main or global

### Safe Sync

Running `sync` from `DispatchQueue` sometimes can raise an exception if it is called in the same `DispatchQueue`. 
To avoid this, you can use `safeSync` instead which will check the current queue first and decide whether it needs to run the block right away or by using the default `sync`.
You don't need to register the `DispatchQueue` since it will automatically register the `DispatchQueue` before checking:

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.safeSync {
    print("this will safely executed")
}
```

### Async if needed

Sometimes you want to execute the operation right away if it's in the right `DispatchQueue` instead of running it asynchronously by using `async`.
Like when you update UI, it's better if you run it right away instead of putting it in the asynchronous queue if you are already in DispatchQueue.main.
You can use `asyncIfNeeded` to achieve that functionality right away. It will check the current `DispatchQueue` and decide whether it needs to run right away or by using the default `async`.
You don't need to register the `DispatchQueue` since it will automatically register the `DispatchQueue` before checking:

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncIfNeeded {
    print("this will executed right away or asynchronously if in different queue")
}
```
